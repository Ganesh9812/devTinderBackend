lets send user data in the api instead of in the code
i should be sending data from postman and my api should receive the data and push into the db
i should be sending json data to the server and server should be pushing that data into the db
raw data and json in postman
so express will convert req into object and will give us to use it
req.body if we console
we are getting undefined
because we are getting json data and our server is not able to read the json data
to read the json data we need the help of a middleware which i can use for all my apis
this middleware takes the incoming request and converts json into js object and put it into the body and give us the access to the data
this middle given by express and this is express.json()
app.use(express.json());
this will now activated for all the routes
now req.body will be js object

now lets ready the data from db
get api to get all the users

//get user by email
app.get("/user", async (req, res) => {
const userEmail = req.body.emailId;
try {
const users = await User.find({ emailId: userEmail });
if (users.length === 0) {
res.status(400).send("User not found");
} else {
res.send(users);
}
} catch (err) {
res.status(400).send("something went wrong");
}
});

right now here users in an array and find gives the duplicates as well if found

but there is a method findOne this will give only one user

also now lets see how we can make unique emailid rule

now udpate api
app.patch
//findoneandupadte({\_id: id}) is equivalent to findbyidandupdate(id)
