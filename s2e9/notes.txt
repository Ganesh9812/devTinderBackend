encrypting passwords
we store our passwords as plain text into the db
but we should not
lot of security issues
password should be store in encrypted or hash format
nobody should be able to see the password
lets see how can we keep our password safe

signup api lot of issues
lets first resolve them
never truest request.body data coming from api and attacker can send any bad data
even before const user = new User(req.body); we need to do the validation of data
if data not correct throw error
if data is correct then encrypt the password and then store this into the db
validate
encrypt
store the password in db

these validations we can do in db schema or validateSignUpData

once validation is done
then install bcryp libraray for password encryption
now using bcrypt create a hash
brcypt.hash returns a promise
const passwordHash = bcrypt.hash(password, 10);
10 is the salt rounds, more the salt rounds, more the complex the encryption

now talk about login
whenever we login we need to check the password right
lets create a login api as well
