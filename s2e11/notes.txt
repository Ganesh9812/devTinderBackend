lets build more apis

# DevTinder Apis

- POST /signup
- POST /login
- POST /logout

- GET /profile/view
- PATCH /profile/edit
- PATCH /profile/password

- POST /request/send/interested/:userId
- POST /request/send/ignored/:userId

- POST /request/review/accepted/:requestId
- POST /request/review/rejected/:requestId

- GET /connections
- GET /requests/received
- GET /feed - gets you the profiles of other users on platform

status: ignored, interested, accepted, rejected

its not recommended to created all apis in app.js file
so create express router and handle routing in a proper way using express router
we will use express router to manage our apis efficiently

we will create different routers to handle apis
we create one route for login/signup/logout
and another router to handle set of apis
so we can create authRouter and we can login/signup/logout apis here

same profileRouter

this is for best practice
auth.js manages the routes specific to auth

app.use is same as router.use
const app = express()
const router = express.Router()

lets build the logout api
while creating a token you will set the expriy time
and also in res.cookie also you can set the expiry time
which is useful for logout api
