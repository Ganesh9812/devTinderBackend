validations on the database
need to check what we send to our db
so that only valid data is sent to the db
we are more into the post api or patch api where we need to have more checks
mandatory fields like email, password required to signup
so make fields mandatory by using required
when we use required, user should mention these fields for sure either in api or in front end, these are mandatory else mongoose will not allow insertion into the db

and also if want only one entry of emailid which means unique email in db
which can throw email already exists
so use unique field
it will not allow me to insert the same emailid into my db
we can also add a default value
for eg: about: "this is a default about"

by default validate method is called only when the new document is create not for update case

so now how to know when the user registered into the platform or db like when was he signed up
pass this { timeStamps: true }
in document we will get created at and updated at

now what to do in case if i want my user not to update or change his emailid
how to add this type of check
when im updating the user i should not be able to change the emailid
i need to put api level validation

also if im updating with new field, it will get updated, api is not sanitising the data.
now we should make that we should be able to update only certain fields
const ALLOWED_UPDATES = ["userId","photoUrl", "about", "gender", "age"];
basically we need keep userId even though we are not changing because for updating we need userid else which document we will update
also instead of getting userdId from the body, lets get userId from the url
app.patch("/user/:userId", async (req, res) => {
const ALLOWED_UPDATES = ["photoUrl", "about", "gender", "age"];

now lets suppose we need a emailid, but emailid should be in a format not like a text right, so we need write a big regex instead of this we can take help of a library as well
i can use this for api level validation or db level validaiton
so now adding for schema/db level validation
